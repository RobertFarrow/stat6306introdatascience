## Conclusions:
## In this case study, we are scraping CyberCoders.com for data scientist jobs to help us define data science.  By searching for data science positions, and then getting counts of the key words in the job postings, we can see the skills that employers are looking for in potential hires.  Since the field of data science is an expanding job industry, and a relatively new one, there is not a clear consensus on exactly what skills a data scientist should have.  Also, with the constantly changing and emerging tools that a data scientist should posses, the definition of data scientist is also continuously evolving.
## There are several interesting conclusions we can draw from the word counts we have generated.  The most common word phrase is Machine Learning, with a count of 96.  With new processes being developed to work with the ever growing amount of data, a data scientist needs to be able to evolve with the new processes and challenges that a data scientist faces.  Python, the second most common word in the job postings, which has a count of 87, is a relatively new programming language.  Data scientists should be able to work in Python, and if they are not familiar with Python, then they should be able to become familiar with Python.  Becoming familiar with Python, or learning new techniques in Python, is an example of Machine Learning.  The rest of the skills with large counts, words or phrases which show up more than 20 times, are different types of programming language and the ability to implement these types of language to be a successful data scientist.
## The list of key words from the CyberCoders.com job postings gives us insight into what a data scientist does and the skills they need to have.  A data scientist needs to be able to write code and analyze results, and they should be able to use several different programming languages.  They should also be able to learn new programming languages and develop new skills since the field of data science is constantly changing.
## Lessons in R:
## I learned how to use grepl and got a better understanding of how to use matrices.  When we created the object tt, it was a list with 1 column of the counts of the key words.  The key words we were counting were the dimnames for tt.  In order for grepl to work on the dimnames, I had to turn them into a column.  The best way I found to do this is to convert tt to a matrix, isolate the dimnames, and then add them to tt using cbind.
